            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Robotics and video games has always been a passion of mine since I was
                a kid. From tinkering with different electronics to building mansions
                on Minecraft, I developed an interest in creation and design. With a 
                new wave of AI technologies, I want to be able to combine my interests
                with these innovative artifical intelligent algorithms and work with
                AI-controlled robots. This website encompasses a collection of my work
                experiences, skillsets, and projects done throughout my time in college.</p>
            <p>Some of my hobbies include watching anime, building and learning more 
                about gaming PCs, deep diving into conspiracy theories, reading manga 
                and webcomics, hiking, and chilling with my dog, Mochi, and turtle Breakkie.
                (Breakkie is short for breakfast ðŸ’€)</p>
