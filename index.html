        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Robotics and video games has always been a passion of mine since I was
            a kid. From tinkering with different electronics to building mansions
            on Minecraft, I developed an interest in creation and design. With a 
            new wave of AI technologies, I want to be able to combine my interests
            with these innovative artifical intelligent algorithms and work with
            AI-controlled robots. This website encompasses a collection of my work
            experiences, skillsets, and projects done throughout my time in college.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include watching anime, building and learning more 
            about gaming PCs, deep diving into conspiracy theories, reading manga 
            and webcomics, hiking, and chilling with my dog, Mochi.
